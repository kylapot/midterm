            <p>The major reason to visit El Nido is for the breathtaking vistas of nature.

                 are uncrowded, unlike the famous Boracay. Kayaking around the lagoons is a 
                 terrific way to discover the islets, coves, and caves, which are plentiful.</p>

                 The island across town is home to incredible fauna such as
                 monkeys, large reptiles, and hornbill birds. Rent a transparent

            <h3>Taraw Cliff</h3>
            <p>
                 Climb to El Nido's highest peak. Before climbing these steep rocks,
                 it is essential that you hire a guide and wear appropriate footwear.
                 You will get a fantastic perspective of the entire area once you
                 reach the summit.

            <h3>Nakpan Beach</h3>
            <p>
                Nacpan can accommodate a large number of people and never seems
                 overcrowded. If you don't want to join the mob, head to Duli Beach 
                 instead. Sunsets on Nacpan are stunning, but we don't advocate
                 driving back to El Nido after dark.
