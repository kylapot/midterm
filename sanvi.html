            <p>It is endowed with pristine verdant woods, gorgeous islands, 
                spectacular waterfalls, enthralling mangroves, and a diversified 
                flora and fauna. San Vicente is also home to Port Barton, another 
                top Palawan destination. It attracts backpackers who seek a relaxed 
                rural atmosphere.</p>

            <h2 id="cont">Why San Vicente ?</h2>
            <p>Port Barton, the municipality's principal tourist hamlet,
                 is recognized as a backpacker's paradise. However, many
                  tourists are unaware that there is another fantastic 
                  location nearby. It is the poblacion of San Vicente. 
                  To be honest, we liked it even better than Port Barton 
                  since it's more raw and true, and there's more to do, as 
                  you'll see in this piece. San Vicente isn’t a famous tourist d
                  estination - yet. When we went, we believed it was incredibly 
                  underestimated, and we saw a lot of potential for it to become 
                  a popular tourist destination in Palawan. Some of the highlights 
                  include spectacular island hopping, the Philippines' longest 
                  white beach, and an outstanding tropical observation point.</p>
